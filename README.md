# chat
Simple chat app I made using angular.js and bootstrap, hosted on node.js server using express.js and socket.io to support real time chat. The app is hosted on Heroku Cloud Application Platform (https://www.heroku.com/) and can be found here: **https://limitless-reaches-1532.herokuapp.com/**
# TODO
* ~~Create node.js chat server~~ (done)
* ~~Make app available online~~ (done)
* Add Mongo.db database
* Enable users to create accounts and start their own chatrooms
* Have a lot of fun working and learning new things about JavaScript and it's awesomeness (still in progress)

# Deployment
To deploy the app, just install node dependencies using
```bash
npm install
```
that's it, that's why I love node <3
